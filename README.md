# Movie Searcher

This projects aim to build a convenient graphical user interface for searching and saving movies.
This project uses APIs for gathering latest movie data: https://api.themoviedb.org/, http://www.omdbapi.com/

It was done in co-operation with a project partner, where I mostly implemented and designed the user interface elements, 
and he mostly designed and implemented the software architecture and the data gathering.

## Getting Started

To use the movie searcher, clone the files and run it as a basic C# project.

## Using the interface

On the right side of each movie theres three buttons from top to bottom: 'add to watchlist', 'mark as watched', and 'add to favorites'.
Interface shows ratings for IMDB, rotten tomatoes and metacritic. Clicking the title doesn't show up more information, 
as purpose of this application is just getting quick eyesight of the latest movies and which movies would fit persons needs.

User can search movies from the top left search bar. 
User is able to remove movies marked as watched from the movie listing, by ticking the 'Remove watched'.
